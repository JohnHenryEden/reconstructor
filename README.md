    - Editing Functionality: `editDrawing` and `replaceStartWithEditButton` provide functionality to edit existing molecule drawings, including retrieving and sending data back to the ChemDoodle sketcher.
2. **Creatediv.js**
    - Mapping Buttons to Divs: The button_to_div object serves as a mapping between sidebar button IDs and corresponding div names. This allows for a clean and scalable way to associate each button with a specific content section.

    - Event Listener Initialization: When the document is fully loaded (DOMContentLoaded event), the code selects all elements with the class .dynamic-button-side-button. It iterates through these buttons and checks if the button's ID exists in the button_to_div mapping.

    - Toggle Visibility: When a button is clicked:
        - It checks the corresponding divâ€™s current display status.
        - If the div is visible (display: block), the code hides the div and removes the 'active' class from the button.
        - If the div is hidden, it shows the div and adds the 'active' class to the button.

    - Dynamic Button State Management: The refreshSideButtons function is used to synchronize the button states with the visibility of the corresponding divs
    - It iterates through the button_to_div entries.
    - For each entry, it checks if the associated div is visible.
    - If the div is visible, it adds the 'active' class to the button; otherwise, it removes the class.
    - Initial State Synchronization: The refreshSideButtons function is called on window.onload, ensuring that when the page is loaded or refreshed, the    sidebar buttons reflect the correct state based on which divs are currently visible.

3. **Displayalldivs.js**
    - Loading Div Data: The first three function calls (loadAtomMappingDiv, loadChemInfoDiv, loadMetaboliteInfoDiv) populate the relevant divs with data from reactionData.

    - Updating Status Dots: The updateStatusDots function is called twice to update the status dots for both substrates and products, indicating whether metabolites were found.

    - Displaying Additional Information: displayReactionMessage and displayreactioninfo functions are used to show other relevant reaction information.

    - Refresh Side Buttons: Finally, refreshSideButtons is called to ensure that the state of the side buttons accurately reflects the visibility of the divs.

4. **displayAtomMapping.js**
    - Message Container Initialization:
        - The function begins by selecting the reactionFoundMessage element to potentially display messages.
        - The contentDiv associated with atom mapping is also selected for further manipulation.
        - It clears any previous messages in the reactionFoundMessage element.
    - Error Handling:
        - If reactionData contains an error, it formats the error message (replacing line breaks with HTML <br> tags).
        - The error message is then displayed in a modal (#error-modal), and the page scrolls to the top to ensure visibility.
    - Updating Atom Mapping Image:
        - If no error is present, it first retrieves the existing image element (reactionImage) in the contentDiv.
        - The function stores relevant attributes (class, name, id) of the image and then removes the old image element.
        - A new image element is created with the same attributes and a new source URL that includes a cache buster to prevent caching issues.
        - The new image element is then appended to the contentDiv.
    - Blowup Effect:
        - After the new image has loaded, a "blowup" effect is applied to it using jQuery, which allows for a zoomed-in view of the image when hovered over. The lens is customized in size and appearance (https://github.com/paulkr/blowup.js).
    - Div Visibility:
        - Finally, the contentDiv is set to be visible (display: block) to ensure the updated content is shown to the user.

        - Errors related to the AI response (e.g., no reactions predicted) or network issues are shown in a dedicated error container, making it clear to the user what went wrong.

- **Dynamic Content Handling**
    - The AI's response, once received, is dynamically formatted into HTML and displayed within the `llmResponseContainer`.
    - The script caches the HTML content (`llm_html`) to avoid unnecessary recomputation or fetch requests when toggling the display of the AI's response.

- **Notes**
    - The script includes a mechanism to handle CSRF tokens automatically, ensuring that the POST request to the server is secure.
    - The temperature slider allows the user to adjust the "creativity" or variability of the AI's predictions, with the current value displayed in real-time.
    - The response handling logic is designed to provide immediate feedback to the user, either by showing the AI predictions or by displaying an error message if the predictions cannot be generated.

6. ### **reactionChecking.js**

- **General Overview**
    - This script manages the selection of reactions by users through checkboxes on a webpage. It keeps track of the checked reactions by storing their IDs in an array.

- **Global Variables**
    - **checkedReactions**:
        - An array that stores the IDs of reactions that have been checked by the user.

- **Event Listeners**
    - **DOMContentLoaded**:
        - Initializes the script once the DOM is fully loaded. It sets up event listeners on all checkboxes with the class `.reaction-checkbox`.

    - **Checkboxes (change)**:
        - Attaches a `change` event listener to each checkbox.
        - **Logic**:
            - When a checkbox is checked:
                - The reaction ID (stored in the `data-reaction-id` attribute of the checkbox) is added to the `checkedReactions` array if it is not already present.
            - When a checkbox is unchecked:
                - The reaction ID is removed from the `checkedReactions` array if it exists in the array.

- **Functions**
    - The script does not define additional functions but leverages the `change` event listener to dynamically update the `checkedReactions` array based on user interaction with the checkboxes.

- **Notes**
    - The `checkedReactions` array is intended to be used elsewhere in the application to perform actions on the selected reactions (e.g., submitting them for processing or deletion).
    - The script ensures that the `checkedReactions` array remains synchronized with the user's checkbox selections, dynamically updating the array as the user checks or unchecks items.

- **Use Cases**
    - This script is useful in scenarios where users need to select multiple items (reactions) on a page and perform batch operations on them.

7. ### **reactionViewandDelete.js**

- **General Overview**
    - This script handles user interactions for viewing, cloning, saving, and deleting reactions in a web application. It includes functions for navigating to reaction editing pages, cloning reactions, saving reactions with user flags, and confirming deletion of reactions.

- **Event Listeners**
    - **.view-btn (click)**:
        - Attaches a click event listener to buttons with the class `.view-btn`.
        - **Logic**:
            - Redirects the user to an edit page for the selected reaction.
            - The reaction ID is retrieved from the `reactions` array using the button's index and is included as a URL parameter.

- **Functions**
    - **cloneReaction(reactionId)**:
        - Prompts the user to enter a name for the cloned reaction, then sends a POST request to the server to create an identical copy of the reaction with the new name.
        - **Parameters**:
            - `reactionId`: The ID of the reaction to be cloned.
        - **Logic**:
            - The function uses `FormData` to send the reaction ID, user ID, and new reaction name to the server.
            - Upon success, the page is reloaded to reflect the newly cloned reaction.
            - In case of an error, an alert is shown to the user.

    - **savedReactionModal(userID, reactionId, saveReaction)**:
        - Saves a reaction with a specific name and flag, selected by the user, to the user's saved reactions.
        - **Parameters**:
            - `userID`: The ID of the user saving the reaction.
            - `reactionId`: The ID of the reaction being saved.
            - `saveReaction`: The URL endpoint for saving the reaction.
        - **Logic**:
            - Retrieves the reaction's short name and selected flag details (name and color) from the modal inputs.
            - Sends a POST request with the reaction data to the server.
            - If successful, the modal is closed, and the user is notified of the successful save.
            - If an error occurs, the user is alerted with an appropriate message.

    - **confirmDelete(reactionName)**:
        - Prompts the user to confirm the deletion of a reaction.
        - **Parameters**:
            - `reactionName`: The name of the reaction to be deleted.
        - **Returns**:
            - A boolean value indicating whether the user confirmed the deletion.

- **Notes**
    - The script assumes that the `reactions` array is globally available and contains the necessary reaction data, including primary keys (`pk`).
    - The `csrftoken` variable must be correctly defined or fetched elsewhere in the application to ensure secure POST requests.
    - The `savedReactionModal` function requires that the user be logged in and that the reaction exists before attempting to save it. Proper error handling is implemented to alert the user if these conditions are not met.
    - The cloning and deletion functions are designed to provide clear prompts and confirmations to ensure users do not perform unintended actions.

- **Error Handling**
    - Errors during network requests (e.g., cloning or saving a reaction) are caught and displayed to the user via alerts.
    - The script also includes basic validation and error messages when necessary inputs are missing (e.g., missing reaction name or user ID).

8. ### **search_reaction.js**

- **General Overview**
    - This script enables a live search functionality for filtering a list of reactions displayed in a table. As the user types in the search input, the table rows are dynamically filtered based on the search query, matching against multiple columns.

- **Event Listeners**
    - **DOMContentLoaded**:
        - Initializes the script once the DOM is fully loaded. It sets up the search functionality by attaching an event listener to the search input field.

    - **#searchInput (input)**:
        - Attaches an `input` event listener to the search input field (`#searchInput`).
        - **Logic**:
            - Captures the user's search query and converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
            - Iterates through all rows in the reaction list table (`#reactionList`) and checks if any of the relevant columns (reaction name, subsystem, substrates, products) contain the query.
            - If a match is found in any of these columns, the row remains visible. Otherwise, the row is hidden.

- **Functionality**
    - **Live Search**:
        - The script filters the table rows in real-time as the user types into the search input. This immediate feedback makes it easier for users to find specific reactions based on various criteria.
        - **Columns Searched**:
            - **Reaction Name**: The second column in the table, representing the name of the reaction.
            - **Subsystem**: The third column, representing the subsystem associated with the reaction.
            - **Substrates**: The fourth column, representing the substrates involved in the reaction.
            - **Products**: The fifth column, representing the products of the reaction.

- **Performance Considerations**
    - The search operation is performed on all rows of the table each time the user types a character. For very large tables, this could potentially impact performance, so it is optimized for smaller datasets or tables with a moderate number of rows.

- **Notes**
    - The script assumes that the table structure is consistent and that the reaction name is in the second column, subsystem in the third, substrates in the fourth, and products in the fifth.
    - The script uses `Array.from()` to convert the HTMLCollection of rows into an array for easier manipulation using array methods like `forEach`.

- **Error Handling**
    - The script does not include explicit error handling but relies on the assumption that the table and its rows exist and are correctly structured. If any of the cells or elements are missing, it could result in undefined behavior.

9. ### **utilities.js**

- **General Overview**
    - This script provides utility functions used across different parts of the web application. These functions include tooltip management, input validation, display of validation messages, and button state management.

- **Functions**

    - **formatTooltipContent(element, type, compartment)**:
        - Formats the content for a tooltip based on the provided element, type, and compartment.
        - **Parameters**:
            - `element`: A string representing the name or identifier of the element (e.g., a metabolite).
            - `type`: The type of the element (e.g., substrate, product).
            - `compartment`: The compartment in which the element is located.
        - **Logic**:
            - Trims the `element` to a maximum of 20 characters, appending '...' if it exceeds this length.
            - Combines the formatted element, type, and compartment into a single string.
        - **Returns**:
            - A formatted string suitable for use as tooltip content.

    - **setupTooltips()**:
        - Attaches event listeners to elements with the class `.detail-item` or `.info-symbol` to display tooltips on mouse hover.
        - **Logic**:
            - On `mouseenter`, a tooltip is created and appended to the hovered element, displaying the content from the element's `data-tooltip-content` attribute.
            - On `mouseleave`, the tooltip is removed from the DOM.

    - **validateInputs()**:
        - Validates that all input fields related to substrates and products are filled in, ensuring no empty fields are submitted.
        - **Logic**:
            - Iterates through all elements with the classes `.sub-name-input` and `.prod-name-input`.
            - Checks if any of these input fields are empty (i.e., contain only whitespace).
            - Returns `true` if all fields are valid, `false` otherwise.

    - **displayValidationMessage(display, message = '')**:
        - Displays or hides a validation message within a modal, providing feedback to the user.
        - **Parameters**:
            - `display`: A boolean value indicating whether to show (`true`) or hide (`false`) the validation message.
            - `message`: The validation message text to display (default is an empty string).
        - **Logic**:
            - If the message container does not exist, it is created and styled.
            - The message is inserted at the top of the modal content. If `display` is `false`, the message is removed.
            - The modal scrolls to the top to ensure the message is visible to the user.

    - **setButtonState(isDisabled)**:
        - Enables or disables the confirmation button based on the provided state.
        - **Parameters**:
            - `isDisabled`: A boolean indicating whether to disable (`true`) or enable (`false`) the button.
        - **Logic**:
            - If `isDisabled` is `true`, the confirmation button is disabled and styled with a 'button-disabled' class.
            - If `isDisabled` is `false`, the button is re-enabled and the 'button-disabled' class is removed.

- **Notes**
    - These utility functions are designed to be reusable across different modules of the application, helping to manage common tasks like displaying tooltips, validating form inputs, and managing button states.
    - The `displayValidationMessage` function ensures that important validation messages are always prominently displayed to the user, improving the user experience during form submissions.
    - The `setupTooltips` function assumes that elements requiring tooltips have their content stored in a `data-tooltip-content` attribute.

- **Error Handling**
    - The functions are designed to operate smoothly under normal conditions, but there is minimal explicit error handling, as they assume that the DOM elements they interact with exist and are properly structured.
    - The `validateInputs` function assumes that the presence of input fields with specific classes indicates that they are required and must be validated.

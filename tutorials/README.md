| **Create Reaction**          | How to use Constructor to create a new reaction, starting from a template. Metabolites are added from your **Saved Metabolites**, which store non-VMH entries you've used before. These can also be shared with others (see [Share Metabolites](#share-metabolites)). | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GB_BTMA3Eujxv6mmAB9ekW4g9XfSqR14/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Add Info to Reaction**     | Demonstrates how to add metadata to a reaction, such as references. The same method can be used to add external links (e.g., Rhea, MetaNetX) or comments. | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17XvWiILwA-Dpx4C3DlpYyXfLsZ-ZKSu-/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Share Templates**          | How to share reaction templates with other users. The same interface also allows you to create new templates. | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DgnnZvCqWmQ5ejHE25RJDQRQtiUuxOd7/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Inspect Saved Metabolites**| How to browse your collection of non-VMH metabolites. View structural info, rename entries, generate platform-specific abbreviations, or download as `.mol`. | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qooG90V86NAPc5J1xd-3-8y2wvFmZ42W/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Share Metabolites**        | Shows how to select and share one or more of your saved metabolites with other users. | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VYRtvzudWINTks2sg_ZDfj0m4odZjDeA/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **Add Data to External DB**  | From your saved reactions, select a subset and submit them to an external database integrated with Constructor. This tutorial uses **VMH** as an example. | [Watch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q4uCNhdH30vCWwCubDuZ5ZuWSHOHlhTm/view?usp=drive_link) |
